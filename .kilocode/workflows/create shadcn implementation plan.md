# create shadcn implementation plan.md

This workflow is to make the agent pick all the shadcn components to use in advance, and work with the user through any decisions that need to be made.

## Steps

1. Start off by using context7 to look up the shadcn documentation. You need to get familiar with the components you have available to you
2. Give you user's application functional descritpion, come up with a list of every component that needs to be made and decide which shadcn component you will build it from
3. Whenever it is not clear what's the correct component to use (or there isn't a specific component that provide the exact desired behavior), come up with different solutions and present them to the user so they can make an informed decision, with trade off analysis. 
4. Create a document that has all the mappings and extra details to implement the components

## Guildlines

Make sure to use shadcn best practices, and leverage theming as their docs suggest.
