# Frameworks

Frontend: Javascript; Solid.js, Tailswindcss, npm/ pnpm (package magager)

Backend: Python; psycopg3, fastapi, gunicorn, uv (package manager)

Database: Postgresql

# Scope

This is a prototype we're making. This means that redesigns to database do not require data migration scripts. Rather, there should a mock data generator which should be updated to align with the change.

<!-- # Reproducibility

You always develop this as dockerized containers using dockerfiles and docker-compose.yml
This makes reproducibility and redeployment seemless. -->
